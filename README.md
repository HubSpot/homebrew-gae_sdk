This repository contains a Homebrew formula for installing the Google App
Engine SDK with my custom patches. It will be kept up to date with the latest
SDK version that is known to be acceptable for Khan Academy development. It
does not conflict with the standard `google-app-engine` formula, although only
one of these can be `brew link` 'd at a time.
